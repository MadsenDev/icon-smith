- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Harassing, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and when an individual represents the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please report it via GitHub Issues or by emailing the maintainers listed in `SECURITY.md`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who fail to enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may be temporarily or permanently removed from the project team.
