# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

IconSmith is currently in active development. The latest release on `main` is the only supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although IconSmith runs entirely client-side, we still take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability or privacy issue:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue describing the flaw.
2. Email the maintainers at `chris@madsens.dev` (or, if unavailable, open a private security advisory in GitHub).
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce, affected browsers/versions, and any mitigations you suggest.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and will keep you informed as we investigate. Once a fix is ready we will publish a release and disclose the issue responsibly.
