# Smith Suite

Smith Suite is a collection of browser-native design and development tools. Each app runs fully client-side with React, Vite, and Tailwind‚Äîno servers, no uploads, just rapid iteration in your browser. The suite continues to grow, spanning colour, imagery, metadata, accessibility, content, and developer productivity workflows.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Browser-native suite** ‚Äî All tooling runs client-side; React + Vite + Tailwind power the entire experience.
- **Launchpad dashboard** ‚Äî Category-sorted cards and quick nav keep 20+ tools discoverable as the suite grows.
- **Consistent UX** ‚Äî Shared visual language, responsive layouts, and cohesive interaction patterns across every Smith.
- **Export everything** ‚Äî Grab PNGs, sprites, metadata snippets, OG images, markdown HTML, locale merges, diffs, datasets, and more.
- **Helpful guidance** ‚Äî Intelligent hints for colour contrast, tokens, regex flags, dataset configs, and icon quality.
